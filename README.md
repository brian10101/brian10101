<h2>Greetings to whoever is reading this! My name is Brian and I aspire to become a cybersecurity analyst. I became interested in cybersecurity after taking a class about cybersecurity during my freshman year of high school. In said class, I learned about how by becoming a cybersecurity analyst one could help protect a company's information for a career. This peaked my interest as I believe that technology and its applications are becoming more and more used in everyday life thus we need to become better at understanding the dangers that come with it. So in conclusion I aspire to become a cyber security analyst inorder to become better and not only protect my information but to also make a career out of something that deeply interests me.<br><br>

Thank you for taking the time to check out my GitHub profile,<br><br>
Brian</h2>
